# Stitch Prompt for Visual Wireframe Generation

Use the following prompt in Stitch or any AI wireframe/design tool to generate a visual wireframe for the Iterative Generation feature:

```
Create a detailed web app wireframe for an AI-powered project generator and editor. The main screen should include:

- A top navigation bar with: user avatar/name, “New Project”, “Project History”, and “Logout” buttons.
- The project title at the top, with an “Extend Project” button and a prompt input field for project-wide changes.
- A sidebar or main section showing a file/folder tree (e.g., src/, public/), with each file and folder having “View”, “Refine”, and (for files) “Diff” buttons.
- When “Refine” is clicked, show a modal with:
    - The file name
    - A scrollable code preview
    - A prompt input for refinement
    - “Show AI Suggestions”, “Submit”, and “Cancel” buttons
- When “Extend Project” is clicked, show a modal with:
    - The project structure (expandable tree)
    - A prompt input for extension
    - “Show AI Suggestions”, “Submit”, and “Cancel” buttons
- Include a “Version History” modal with a list of previous versions, each with “View” and “Restore” options.
- At the bottom or in a toolbar, include “Download ZIP”, “Share”, “Undo”, “Redo”, and “Show Version History” buttons.
- Show loading spinners and toast notifications for feedback.

Use a clean, modern style with clear separation between navigation, file tree, modals, and action buttons. Indicate modal overlays and highlight interactive elements.
